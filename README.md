Then download the latest version from [the Releases page](https://github.com/hoooknew/pancake-spotify-player/releases) and either run the msi, or extract the zip file.

You'll be prompted with firewall warning. It can be canceled. 
> To sign in, the app starts up a local web server just for sign in to get back the credentials needed to access Spotify.

The app will open a Spotify authorization page in your default web browser. That app will work after you approve.

## Settings

All the settings can be accessed in a context menu that you can open with a right click on the app.
